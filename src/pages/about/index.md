Hi, my name is Ray Thomas. I started this site to share knowledge about FPGA development. Most especially Xilinx FPGAs and VHDL. I am currently a Research Engineer with GTRI, where I work on FPGA designs for Electronic Warfare applications.

If you would like to get in touch, my email address is ray@fpgapro.com.
